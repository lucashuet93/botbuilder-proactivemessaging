## Azure Deployment Prerequisites
This bot has prerequisite requirements in order to deploy the bot to Azure.

This document will enumerate the required prerequisites and show how to install them.

### Overview
There are a small set of CLI tools that will automate the process of deploying this bot to Azure.  These CLI tools are only require for deployment.  If you only plan to run the bot locally, these prerequisites are not required.

### Prerequisites
- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account][10].
- Install the latest version of the [Azure CLI][11] tool. Version 2.0.52 or higher.
- Install the latest `botservice` extension for the Azure CLI tool. Version 0.4.3 or higher.
    1. Ensure any previous version of the `botservice` extension is removed.
        ```bash
        az extension remove -n botservice
        ```
    1. Install the latest `botservice` extension.
        ```bash
        az extension add -n botservice
        ```
    1. Verify you are running version 0.4.3 or higher of the `botservice` extension.
        ```bash
        az extension list
        ```
        To verify the extension version, you should see the following:
        ```json
        {
            "extensionType": "whl",
            "name": "botservice",
            "version": "0.4.3"
        }
        ```
- Install latest version of the `MSBot` CLI tool. Version 4.2.0 or higher.

# Running Locally

## Visual Studio
- Open BotBuilder_ProactiveMessaging.csproj in Visual Studio.
- Open appsettings.json file and add your Microsoft AppId and Secret (proactive messaging won't work without AppId and Secret)
- Run the project (press `F5` key).

## Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator][5] is a desktop application that allows bot 
developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.
- Install the [Bot Framework emulator][6].

Bot will initiate proactive messaging loop after receiving message which contains string *proactive*

## Connect to bot using Bot Framework Emulator **V4**
- Launch the Bot Framework Emulator.
- File -> Open bot and open [BotBuilder_ProactiveMessaging.bot](BotBuilder_ProactiveMessaging.bot).

# Deploy the bot to Azure
See [Deploy your C# bot to Azure][50] for instructions.

The deployment process assumes you have an account on Microsoft Azure and are able to log into the [Microsoft Azure Portal][60].

If you are new to Microsoft Azure, please refer to [Getting started with Azure][70] for guidance on how to get started on Azure.
